## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- `swipeActions` on 2 lists that sharing the same view can sometimes cause broken UI (as experienced in this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71777287/swiftui-incorrect-ui-when-switching-to-a-new-list-from-an-old-one-with-swipe-bu) also)
- `lottie` is still written on UIKit and sometimes not looping as expected in the main screen.
